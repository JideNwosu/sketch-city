# Milestone 1

### Line Following
Our first goal is to make the robot follow a black line on a white background. We implemented an IR sensor at the front of the robot which detects the existence of he black tape. We want to keep the robot on the right edge between the black tape and white ground. When the IR sensor is above the white background, we turn the robot to the left by setting the right servo to full power clockwise and the left servo to low power counter-clockwise. When the IR sensor is above the black tape, we turn the robot to the right by setting the left servo to full power clockwise and the right servo to low power counter-clockwise. This not only allowed us to follow a stright line, but lines with relatively large curvatures as well.
