# Milestone 3: Maze Navigation Algorithm
The goal is to write a maze navigation algorithm that works in simulation and in real life. After the algorithm finishes exploring the maze, an indicator must show that the robot has explored everything explorable, in both simulation and real life. 


### Simulation
We have compiled a simulation with python. 

Unexplored territories are represented by question marks. Walls are represented by white squares. Explored areas are represented by green squares. The robot, or the current position of the robot is represented by a red square. After the algorithm is finished, the current position of the robot turns blue to indicate that all explorable areas are explored


### Real Life
