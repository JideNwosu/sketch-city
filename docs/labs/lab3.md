## LAB 1: FPGA Video Controller and Sound Generation

---

### Objective
This lab is divided into two. One team will take at least two external inputs to the FPGA and display them on a screen. The other team will react to an external input to the FPGA of their choice and generate a short ‘tune’ consisting of at least three tones to a speaker via an 8-bit DAC. Both of these tasks will help towards the design of the final system. In the final competition, all maze information discovered by the robot must be transmitted from the basestation Arduino to the FPGA, and then drawn on a VGA monitor. Once the maze has been completely mapped, the FPGA must generate a short tune to be played on a speaker to signify that the maze-mapping is done.

### Graphics Team: Juan Joel Albrecht, Christine Ou, Yazhi Fan

### Materials
* 1 VGA screen
* 1 VGA cable
* 1 VGA connector (Your lab report must include a section on how the DAC on the provided VGA connectors works and how the resistor values were chosen.)
* 1 VGA switch
* Various resistors

### Reading external inputs to FPGA

### Correctly updating a 4-bit array dependent on the inputs

### Drawing one box on the screen

### Description of how the DAC on the provided VGA connectors works and how the resistor values were chosen.

### Mapping external inputs to four different outputs on the screen

### Acoustic Team: Eric Berg, Alex Katz
