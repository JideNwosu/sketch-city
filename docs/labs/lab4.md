## LAB 4: Radio Communication and Map Drawing

---

### Objective
One group will work on the radio component and the other on the FPGA component. For the final portion of the lab, the work done with the radio will be combined with the work done with the FPGA. Using the Nordic nRF24L01+ transceivers and the corresponding Arduino RF24 library, you will get the robot and video controller to talk to each other. You should ideally be able to send messages from one Arduino to the other Arduino (simulating actual maze information) and have the FPGA display the received data on the monitor.

### Radio Team: Juan Joel Albrecht, Christine Ou, Yazhi Fan

### Materials
* 2 Nordic nRF24L01+ transceivers
* 2 Arduino Unos (one must be shared with the other sub-team)
* 2 USB A/B cables
* 2 radio breakout boards with headers

### Sending information wirelessly between Arduino’s

#### Transmitter Side

#### Receiver Side

### Sending the entire maze wirelessly

### Updating the maze array, dependent only on the updated robot information

#### Transmitter Side

#### Receiver Side

### FPGA Team: Eric Berg, Alex Katz

### Displaying a full 4-by-5 grid array on the screen

### Communicating maze information from the Arduino to the FPGA

### Display the robot location on the screen

### Distinguish what sites have been visited and which haven’t on the screen
