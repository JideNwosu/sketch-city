### Meeting Agenda
The meeting agenda will be set by the team leader and will be announced upon request. Otherwise, it will be announced at the beginning of each meeting. The team leader will guide the meeting and ensure all points of the agenda are covered. He/she is also responsible for assigning uncompleted/remaining tasks to team members.

Anyone who discovers other members who are not living up to this contract should remind them. If these infractions continues, it will be discussed during team meetings. Team should notify course staff if problems become extreme.
Consequences for Failing to Follow Procedures and Fulfill Expectations
Anyone who discovers other members who are not living up to this contract should remind them. If these infractions continues, it will be discussed during team meetings. Team should notify course staff if problems become extreme.

### Work Quality
* Website should be updated at least once every week by Juan and Alex
* At least one design review will be held before each Milestone
* Any individual’s task should be functionally completed one day before the deadline    

### Strategies to fulfill these standards

#### Team Participation
1. To ensure cooperation and equal distribution of tasks, we will set plan, clarify tasks, and maintain good communications. Tasks should be assigned at the end of each meeting, so all members know what they are responsible for during the following week. Major or key tasks should be assigned to at least two people to ensure that they will be completed on time to expectation.
2. To encourage ideas from all team members, we will discuss each individual’s progress during team meetings. All team members should share their opinions, including components that they are not working on.
3. Task maintenance is dependent both on the team leader and team members. All members should complete their tasks to expectation on time. Team leader and other team members should remind individuals who have not presented their promised tasks before deadline and those who have are not responding to messages promptly.98776
4. If an individual is having trouble with his or her task, the individual should first seek help in the team by either posting on Slack or presenting the problem during team meetings. If other team members cannot solve the problem either, the individual should seek help outside the team through Piazza or course staff.   

#### Personal Accountability
1. All team members are expected to attend team meetings on time. If for any reason an individual cannot attend a lab section or a regular meeting, the individual should notify the team before the section or meeting starts.
2. All members are responsible for fulfilling team assignments, timelines, and deadlines. If for unexpected reasons one is having trouble finishing an assignment before the deadline, he/she should notify other members as soon as possible so that others will have enough time to help complete the task.
3. All members are encouraged to communicate with each other regarding any questions, suggestions, and concerns.
4. Important decisions and task assignments should be announced during meetings. If there are disagreements concerning the decisions, members should discuss different options and hold a vote. Final decision will be decided by majority vote.
5. Individual who misses meetings is responsible for checking the team website and or meeting notes for any important decisions and updates. The individual is expected to know what he/she is responsible for during the following week and contribute equally as other members.

#### Consequences for Failing to Follow Procedures and Fulfill Expectations
Anyone who discovers other members who are not living up to this contract should remind them. If these infractions continues, it will be discussed during team meetings. Team should notify course staff if problems become extreme.
